# Cooking_Exploration_Spring2025
Cooking Exploration: Exploring vegan/vegetarian cooking -- mini project 
Project description that inspired this project: 

Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to practice your culinary skills by choosing at least two themes and creating a plant-based recipe at home for each one. 

A brief overview of the recipe
Why you chose this dish, how it connects to the theme, your experience making it, and how it turned out (250 - 300 words per dish)
A short video and photo of your creation! Note: The video can be of you cooking, or can just be of the final creation.
